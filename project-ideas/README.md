# Project Idea #1

## Smart nwm Email Extension

Simple and smart nwm email extension which can do following tasks pretty accurately:

 * Natural language inbox alert - "let me know when I hear about my ppo from adobe"
 * Natural language search - "Can you find me a email with seating arrangement for quiz 2 of cs315"
 * Help me write - "Pretty basic + open-source + completely free alternative of google's help me write in gmail"
 * Controlled inbox filtering - " I don't want to here about lost and found emails"

Some additional stuffs here can be:

 * Can it be fast? running entirely in browser
 * Can it be written in rust? Just for fun

Further improvements can be taken from profs, who can share their requirements from there pov.

# Project Idea #2

## Linux Smart File System Search

Consider the file system as a graph of with any directories being node and leaf nodes being the files.
Embedd this path/file name + probably content in such a way that we can reliably
search for a file with some natural language (may have some contraints here)
